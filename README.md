## Overview

Pinocchio is a zero-dependency library to create Solana programs in Rust. It takes advantage of the way SBF loaders serialize the program input parameters into a byte array that is then passed to the program's entrypoint to define zero-copy types to read the input. Since the communication between a program and SBF loader &mdash; either at the first time the program is called or when one program invokes the instructions of another program &mdash; is done via a byte array, a program can define its own types. This completely eliminates the dependency on the `solana-program` crate, which in turn mitigates dependency issues by having a crate specifically designed to create on-chain programs.

Pinocchio can be used as a replacement for [`solana-program`](https://crates.io/crates/solana-program) to write on-chain programs.

The library defines:
* program entrypoint
* core data types
* logging macros
* `syscall` functions
* access to system accounts (`sysvar`)
* cross-program invocation

## Features

* Zero dependencies and `no_std` crate
* Efficient `entrypoint!` macro â€“ no copies or allocations
* Improved CU consumption of cross-program invocations

## Getting started

From your project folder:

```bash
cargo add pinocchio
```

On your entrypoint definition:
```rust
use pinocchio::{
  account_info::AccountInfo,
  entrypoint,
  entrypoint::ProgramResult,
  msg,
  pubkey::Pubkey
};

entrypoint!(process_instruction);

pub fn process_instruction(
  program_id: &Pubkey,
  accounts: &[AccountInfo],
  instruction_data: &[u8],
) -> ProgramResult {
  msg!("Hello from my program!");
  Ok(())
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should use the types from the `pinocchio` crate instead of `solana-program`. If you need to invoke a different program, you will need to redefine its instruction builder to create an equivalent instruction data using `pinocchio` types.
