#  `pinocchio`

A zero-dependency library to create Solana programs in Rust. This library can be used as a replacement for [`solana-program`](https://crates.io/crates/solana-program) to write on-chain programs.

This library defines:
* program entrypoint
* core data types
* logging macros
* `syscall` functions
* access to system accounts (`sysvar`)
* cross-program invocation
